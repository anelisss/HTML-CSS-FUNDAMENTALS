    <blockquote style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        Wait a minute. I said I wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? There's</br>
        nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture. That's not what I had in</br>
        mind. The type is all in Helvetica, which I like, but it doesn't excite me at all. There is just no</br>
        character to anything here. It has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla. I really need</br>
        something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.</br>
